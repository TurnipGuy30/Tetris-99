# **Tetris 99**

At first, **Tetris** games can be intimidating.

If you don't understand the colours, shapes, and techniques, it can be difficult to keep up.

Anyone can play **Tetris**. However, it takes some time and effort to gain speed and confidence. Hopefully you can take something away from this guide, and become a **Tetris** expert!

> Important notes:
> - This guide is written specifically for **Tetris 99**, but has information related to all **Tetris** games. If you are reading this guide with the intention of using the information for a game that is not **Tetris 99**, you can read through the guide as it is, while ignoring topics such as online multiplayer, DLC content, or Daily Missions.
> - This guide assumes you have a bit of experience with **Tetris**. It covers most of the very basics, but I *highly* recommend playing **Tetris 99** or another **Tetris** game before reading this guide.
> - A large majority of the information in this guide is taken from the [Tetris Guide](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetris_Guide).
