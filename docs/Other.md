## Other Information

Here is some other information not related to strategy.

### **Daily Missions**

Consistently completing **Daily Missions** means you'll have a constant supply of Tickets. Always remember that you can take as many rounds as you want to complete each goal, so don't stress.

### Themes

Each theme has a unique tile set, background, music track, and set of sound effects. Themes can make **Tetris 99** a little more interesting. Just keep in mind that you'll need to get used to the new look of the Tetriminoes.

### DLC modes

There are four DLC modes that you can buy from the `Nintendo eShop`, (you can also buy them combined in the form of the `Big Block DLC`). The DLC modes can be useful for practice, but they aren't required to improve your skills. The `Big Block DLC` costs AU$15.00 at the time of writing.
