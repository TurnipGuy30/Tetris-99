# Advanced Skills

Here are some advanced techniques and rules that won't always fit in with your play style, but are worth keeping in mind.

## **T-Spin Triples**

The hardest **T-Spin** to perform is the **T-Spin Triple**. It requires a precise setup where a `T`-Mino is kicked into a slot. Here's what it looks like:

```
| - - T - - - - - - - |
| - T T T - - - - - - |
| - - - - - - - - - - |
| - - - - X X - - - - |
| - - - - - X X X X X |
| X X X X - X X X X X |
| X X X - - X X X X X |
| X X X X - X X X X X |
=======================
```

The `T`-Mino must be moved down, then right, then rotated counterclockwise to **Wall Kick** into the T-shaped slot below.

Also, there is an overhang left over after the **T-Spin Triple** is performed.

```
| - - - - X X - - - - |
| - - - - - X X X X X |
=======================
```

This is an example of a setup for a **T-Spin Triple**:

```
| - - T - - - - - - - |
| - T T T - - - - - - |
| - - - - - S S - - - |
| - - - - S S Z J - - |
| I - - - - Z Z J - - |
| I L L L - Z J J O O |
| I L T - - O O L O O |
| I T T T - O O L L L |
=======================
```

While the **T-Spin Triple** is difficult to set up, it sends the most **Junk** of any single-Mino clear. Try performing a **T-Spin Triple** at the start of your next round.

## **Perfect Clears**

The **Perfect Clear** (AKA **All Clear**) occurs when all Tetriminoes are cleared from the **Matrix**, i.e. the **Matrix** is empty. This mechanic takes practice, and is not always possible, but is good practice for **Matrix** management. Performing a **Perfect Clear** will display a message in the **Matrix**, and send four **Junk** lines.

## **Tetris Maximus**

It's what everyone craves from their first game of **Tetris 99**: The mystical title of **Tetris Maximus**. If you manage to surpass all 98 others, you will be crowned with this beautiful title across your screen. Good luck!
