## Advanced Skills

Here are some advanced techniques and rules; easy to understand, but in the heat of a match, difficult to pull off.

### **T-Spin Triples**

WIP

### **Perfect Clears**

The **Perfect Clear** (AKA **All Clear**) occurs when all Tetriminoes are cleared from the **Matrix**, i.e. the **Matrix** is empty. This can be tricky to pull off, and may be unnecessary to learn, but just keep it in mind. You never know when it might come in handy!

### **Tetris Maximus**

It's what everyone craves from their first game of **Tetris 99**: The mystical title of **Tetris Maximus**. If you manage to surpass all 98 others, you will be crowned with this beautiful title across your screen. Good luck!
